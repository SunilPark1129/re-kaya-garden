## Self-improvement
> In the past, while creating a website, I took notes of the parts that need to be fixed.<br>Old Site - [Link](https://github.com/SunilPark1129/kaya-garden)
- [x] I need to practice / create more complex coding.
  - I practiced a lot / Reduced hardcoding of duplicate lines using functions.
- [x] I need to be proficient with CSS styling so that users can understand what those UI are used for.
  - The design elements have been changed to help users understand how to use the website. (in the past it was difficult to know what to click in the menu section)
